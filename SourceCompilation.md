First step is to always read the readme file and install all the necessary libs and tools

Now run the configure file using 
```bash
./configure
```

Now to compile final utility use make or cmake we are going to use make here

```bash
make
```

Now we will be able to see the binary here

if we use *sudo make install* it would install the binary into env path folder so we dont have to run it via using full path
